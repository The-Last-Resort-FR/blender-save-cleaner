# Blender incremental save files cleaner

Blender incremental save files can take quite alot of space and usually pile up because we don't think about deleting them once we don't need them anymore.
Obviously make sure you don't have anything you should keep in these files before using the script

`Usage : .\BlenderSaveCleaning.ps1 <path to folder to be cleaned> <force>`
